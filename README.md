# Summary:
In the "Business Intelligence Dashboard for Atliq Hardwares Sales Insights" project, I successfully extracted and transformed data from the company's MySQL database. As the key contributor, I meticulously cleaned and processed the data using Power BI, ensuring accuracy and reliability. The culmination of this effort resulted in the creation of an aesthetically pleasing and informative dashboard. The dashboard provided comprehensive insights into Atliq Hardwares' financial performance, including profit margins, revenue trends, and region-specific sales analysis.
